        'bio': 'I&apos;ve been interested in hair since my Barbie days, cutting and styling my dollies. I was the girl in school that used to play in everyone&apos;s hair. And as a teenager braided hair to earn some cash. When I was 16 my cousin got me a job as an assistant at her cousins salon. That was my job all through high school and college. I attended the university of Illinois at Chicago from 2005-2009, majoring in business administration. It was my senior year in college when Paul Mitchell the school Chicago was built directly across the street from my campus. I decided to take a tour and I fell in love with how professional the salon was. I had always wanted a career and until then I didn&apos;t see that being a cosmetologist could be a career. I was so excited about it I enrolled in Paul Mitchell while still finishing my degree at UIC.  After I graduated from UIC I decided to move to Atlanta where I transferred from Paul Mitchell to Roberts school of cosmetology. I graduated and got my license in 2011 and have been doing hair professionally since then. I have worked with, been mentored by, and taken classes from some of the best in the industry such as Anthony Cutz, Khimandi, Cynthia Lumzy and HairbyChantellen to name a few. I aspire and take pride in being a well versed stylist who can transition my clients from many different hair trends.',
